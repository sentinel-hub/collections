**The goal of this registry is to expand access to useful data available on Sentinel Hub.** With that in mind, we prefer to list datasets that are clearly documented, are actively supported, can be used for research or educational purposes. Collections are included at the discretion of the Sentinel Hub team, which may remove collections from the registry at any time. Data providers are responsible for maintaining and supporting the data that they share. 

## How are collections added to the registry?

Each collection in this repository is described in a dedicated YAML file stored in [./collections](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/public-collections/tree/main/collections) directory, e.g. /collections/global-land-cover.yaml.  
Data providers can create a new YAML file copying the structure of the most similar existing one. After committing it to the GitHub, create a pull request and Sentinel Hub team will review it and publish it in the Registry.  
Note that for additional external files e.g the thumbnail image to be displayed correctly , store it in a directory that is named similar to the associated YAML file. 
Users are also welcome to revise existing collections, e.g. adding new usage examples , tools, etc.

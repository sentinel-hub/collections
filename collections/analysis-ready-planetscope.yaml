Name: Analysis-Ready PlanetScope 
Description: |
  Analysis-ready PlanetScope combines the monitoring benefits of daily 3 m spatial imagery, while enhancing temporal and spatial consistency with trusted, third-party data sources (Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, VIIRS). 
  This is accomplished with a proprietary algorithm that creates pre-processed, harmonized, and spatially consistent daily stacks of images that enable time-series analysis and machine learning applications. 
  The resulting 4-band data is exceedingly radiometrically and geometrically accurate thanks to vast amounts of reference data in the Planet Archive. With deeper and more extensive pre-processing, data is more precise and pre-formatted for time-series analysis and machine learning applications

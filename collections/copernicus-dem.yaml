Name: Copernicus DEM
Description: |
  [The Copernicus DEM](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/collections/copernicus-digital-elevation-model) is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) 
  which represents the bare-Earth surface and all above ground natural and built features.
  It is based on [WorldDEMâ„¢ ](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/imagery/reference-layers/worlddem/) DSM that is derived from [TanDEM-X](https://tandemx-science.dlr.de/) 
  and is infilled on a local basis with the following DEMs: ASTER, SRTM90, SRTM30, SRTM30plus, GMTED2010, TerraSAR-X Radargrammetric DEM, ALOS World 3D-30m.
  Copernicus Programme provides Copernicus DEM in 3 different instances: COP-DEM EEA-10, COP-DEM GLO-30 and COP-DEM GLO-90 where 
  "COP-DEM GLO-90" tiles and most of the "COP-DEM GLO-30 " tiles are available worldwide with free license.
  Sentinel Hub provides two instances named COPERNICUS_90 which uses "COP-DEM GLO-90" and COPERNICUS_30 which uses "COP-DEM GLO-30 Public"
  and "COP-DEM GLO-90" in areas where "COP-DEM GLO-30 Public" tiles are not yet released to the public by Copernicus Programme.
  Copernicus DEM provides elevation data and can also be used for the orthorectification of satellite imagery (e.g Sentinel 1).

Name: Crop Biomass
Description: |
  [Crop Biomass](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) provides the ability to track and respond to the highly dynamic nature of biomass in agricultural fields throughout the season. 
  This enables better-informed decisions, input optimization, interventions, and harvest planning. 
  This is a relative measure of biomass, so each pixel value has a value of 0 (low biomass) to 1 (high biomass). 
  The product is provided daily and every day, the user gets a new raster with the data from the most updated direct observation from the day before.

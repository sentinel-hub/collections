# Crop Biomass

## Short Description

[Crop Biomass](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) provides the ability to track and respond to the highly dynamic nature of biomass in agricultural fields throughout the season. This enables better-informed decisions, input optimization, interventions, and harvest planning. This is a relative measure of biomass, so each pixel value has a value of 0 (low biomass) to 1 (high biomass). The product is provided daily and every day, the user gets a new raster with the data from the most updated direct observation from the day before.<br /><br />

A collection of Crop Biomass for a limited area and time of interest is available with the CC-BY-SA license.

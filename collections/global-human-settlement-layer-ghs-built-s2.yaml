Name: GLobal Human Settlement Layer - GHS-BUILT-S2
Description: |
  The Global Human Settlement (GHS) framework produces global maps of built-up, population density
  and settlements to monitor human presence on Earth over time.
  The GLobal Human Settlement Layer GHS-BUILT-S2 is a global map of built-up areas (expressed as probabilities) at 10 m spatial resolution.
  It was derived from a Sentinel-2 global image composite for the reference year 2018 using Convolutional Neural Networks.

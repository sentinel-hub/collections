Name: Global Land Cover
Description: |
  Global Land Cover products at 100 m resolution are delivered annually by the 
  [global component of the Copernicus Land Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc). 
  The most recent collection 3 (version 3.0.1) of 100 m Land Cover products for the years 2015 - 2019 were generated from 
  the PROBA-V 100 m and 300 m satellite observations and several other ancillary datasets with global coverage. 
  These Land Cover products provide a main discrete land cover classification map according to UN-FAO Land Cover Classification System [LCCS](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc). 
  Additional continuous fractional layers for all basic land cover classes which give the percentage of
  a 100 m pixel that is filled with a specific land cover class, are also included in the Land Cover products to
  provide more detailed information on each land cover class.

Name: Land Surface Temperature
Description: |
  Planet’s <a href="https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/" target="_blank">Land Surface Temperature</a> (LST) is a feed of high-resolution, globally available measurement of the skin temperature of the Earth. Combining observations from a range of satellite constellations, Land Surface Temperature is not hindered by clouds, ensuring a continuous, consistent and scientifically reliable data record of more than 20 years. Consequently, there is no requirement to uphold extensive networks of physical sensors.
  This Planetary Variable measures the temperature twice a day (daytime and nighttime) with a spatial resolution of 100 m and 1000 m, providing vital intelligence about our nexus food/water system, and urban living conditions.

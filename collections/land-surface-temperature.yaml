Name: Land Surface Temperature
Description: |
  [Land Surface Temperature](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) provides twice-daily measurements of land surface temperature with high spatial resolution and consistency. 
  LST data eliminates the need for maintaining large networks of physical sensors, reduces the impact of cloud cover on measurements, and enables a more accurate reflection of ground conditions across large areas.

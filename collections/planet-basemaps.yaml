Name: Planet Basemaps
Description: |
 Globally available mosaics at a cell size of 4.77 m (at equator) using Mercator projection. 
 <a href="https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/" target="_blank">Planet Basemaps</a> are offered at a weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly cadence and provide a clear, comprehensive view of an area of interest by automating the selection of the best individual images to create a complete, seamless, and recent “mosaic” that allows you to understand change over broad areas. 
 Planet Basemaps are also well suited for machine learning-analytics by applying cloud masking and radiometric normalization to allow for consistent data across large geographic areas of interest.

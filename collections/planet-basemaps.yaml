Name: Planet Basemaps
Description: |
  Near daily global medium resolution imagery that generates visually consistent and scientifically accurate mosaics. Basemaps provide a clear, comprehensive view of an area of interest. 
  We automate the selection of the best individual images to create a complete, seamless, and recent “mosaic” that allows you to understand change over broad areas. 
  Planet Basemaps are also well suited for machine learning-analytics.

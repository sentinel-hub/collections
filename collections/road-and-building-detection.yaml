Name: Road and Building Detection
Description: |
 Globally available land cover maps derived from Planetscope imagery classifying pixels as road, building or neither. 
 Generated on a weekly or monthly basis,  <a href="https://www.planet.com/products/analytics/" target="_blank"> Planet's Road & Building Detection </a> can be used to stay up to date with the latest development around the globe.  
 By leveraging a semantic segmentation model on all the PlanetScope imagery published in a given area for a given week or month, we assign a probability value (0-255) that the pixel represents a road, building or neither object. 
 These results are aggregated together into a weekly or monthly layer and this process is repeated through time, generating a time-series of pixel values ready for analysis.

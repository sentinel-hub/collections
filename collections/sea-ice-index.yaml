Name: Sea Ice Index
Description: |
  [Sea Ice Index](https://nsidc.org/data/G02135/versions/3) products offer information about ice cover and its trends in the Arctic and Antarctica.
   In this collection, sea ice extent and concentration maps are provided at a resolution of 25 km on a daily basis.
   The products are computed using images from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and 
   Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) instruments on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
   satellites. Sea ice concentrations are generated from 
   [brightness temperature data](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051). Sea ice extent is computed as areas covered by ice
    with a concentration greater than 15 percent. This dataset is for demonstration purposes only and is not maintained.

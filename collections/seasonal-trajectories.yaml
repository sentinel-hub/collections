Name: Seasonal Trajectories, 10-daily
Description: |
 Seasonal Trajectories (ST) product is a filtered time series of [Plant Phenology Index (PPI)](https://www.nateko.lu.se/research/remote-sensing-and-earth-observation/lund-earth-observation-research-group/vegetation-phenology) provided yearly on a 10-daily basis at 10m resolution . 
 It is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), pan-European High Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity [(HR-VPP)](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-vegetation-phenology-and-productivity) product suite. 
 The Seasonal Trajectories PPI is derived through fitting a smoothing and gap filling function to the yearly time-series raw PPI values generated from Sentinel-2 satellite observations. 
 In addition to the PPI band, a QFLAG band  indicating the quality of the smoothing process is included. 
 The Seasonal Trajectories provide the vegetation status for each pixel on a regular 10-day time step from January 1 2017 onwards over the  EEA39 region. 
 More information about ST product is outlined in the [product user manual](https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/product-user-manual-of-seasonal-trajectories/)

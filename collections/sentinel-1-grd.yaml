Name: Sentinel-1 GRD
Description: 
  The [Sentinel - 1 radar imaging mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1)
  is composed of a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites providing continous all-weather, day and night imagery for 
  Land and Maritime Monitoring. C-band synthentic aperture radar imaging has the advantage of operating at wavelenghts that are
  not obstructed by clouds or lack of illumination  and therefore can acquire data during day or night under all weather conditions.
  With  6 days repeat cycle on the entire world and daily acquistions of sea ice zones and Europe's major shipping routes,
  Sentinel-1 ensures reliable data availability to support emergency services and applications requiring time series observations. 
  Sentinel-1 continues the retired ERS and ENVISAT missions. Level 1 GRD products are available since October 2014.

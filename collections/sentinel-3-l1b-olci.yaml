Name: Sentinel-3 OLCI L1B
Description: |
 The [Sentinel -3](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3) is composed of three versatile satellites designed 
 to provide data continuity for the ERS, ENVISAT and SPOT satellites and to support operational land and ocean observataion services.
 Sentinel -3 satellites make use of four main instruments on board; OLCI, SLSTR, SRAL and MWR, to measure sea surface topography, 
 sea and land surface temperature and ocean and land surface color.
 The medium resolution OLCI(Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) is the successor to ENVISAT's MERIS instrument. 
 Since its launch in 2016, OLCI acquires data of the entire globe atleast every 2 days, in 21 bands, from which information on  marine and terrestrial biomass can be derived. 
 OLCI also provides reliable information on the atmosphere, especially on the aerosols characterisation.
 Level 1B data provides calibrated, ortho-geolocated and spatially re-sampled Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances for the 21 OLCI spectral bands.

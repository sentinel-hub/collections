Name: Sentinel-3 SLSTR L1B
Description: |
 The [Sentinel -3](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3) is composed of three versatile satellites designed 
 to provide data continuity for the ERS, ENVISAT and SPOT satellites and to support operational land and ocean observation services.
 Sentinel -3 satellites make use of four main instruments on board; OLCI, SLSTR, SRAL and MWR, to measure sea surface topography, 
 sea and land surface temperature and ocean and land surface color.
 The SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer ) continues the timeline of Sea Surface Temperature measurements from the ATSR instrument series. 
 The principal objective of SLSTR products is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) 
 to a very high level of accuracy (better than 0.3 K for SST) for both climatological and meteorological applications.
 Level 1B provides calibrated and ortho-geolocated Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances for the 6 VNIR/SWIR bands 
 and TOA brightness temperatures for the thermal IR and active fire channels.

Name: Soil Water Content
Description: |
  [Soil Water Content](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) is the measure of the amount of water present in a unit volume of soil. 
  It is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of the soil. 
  This measurement is crucial for understanding the water status of the soil, providing insights into factors like drought monitoring, soil health, and hydrological processes. 
  The Soil Water Content Planetary Variable provides near-daily measurements of soil water content data with spatial resolution of 100 m and 1000 m. 
  It is unhindered by clouds and has a long and consistent data record of more than 20 years, eliminating the need for maintaining large networks of physical sensors.

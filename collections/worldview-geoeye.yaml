  [Maxar Technologies](https://www.maxar.com/) offers multi-spectral, high resolution, commercial satellite imagery acquired 
  by currently four on-orbit and three retired [constellation of satellites](https://www.maxar.com/constellation) 
  namely WorldView, GeoEye, QuickBird and IKONOS.
  Sentinel Hub offers a possibility to purchase, order and access Worldview and Geoeye satellite imagery ordered through [European Space Imaging](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/static/files/data/maxar/world-view/resources/brochures/EUSI_Company_Brochure.pdf).
  The data available for purchase through Sentinel Hub are GeoEye-1 (GE01), WorldView-2 (WV02), WorldView-3 (WV03) and WorldView-4 (WV04).
  WorldView-4 data available for purchase is the imagery archive acquired from  November 2016 to January 2019 while the satellite was operational.
  The rest of the constellation offers both, imagery archive available since 2009  and a tasking capability to acquire images systematically over an area of interest. 
  The archived images are available sporadically over an area of interest since images  are in general not acquired systematically.
